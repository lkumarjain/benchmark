# Benchmark

A benchmark is a type of function that executes a code segment multiple times and compares each output against a standard, assessing the code’s overall performance level.

[![Benchmark Golang Libraries](https://github.com/lkumarjain/benchmark/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lkumarjain/benchmark/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml)

The idea of this repository is to have multiple benchmarks of multiple Golang libraries at one place.

- [Benchmarks of expression evaluation libraries for Golang](./expression-evaluation/)
- [Benchmarks of in-memory cache libraries for Golang](./in-memory-cache/)
